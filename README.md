# AirPollutionApp
Calls OpenWeatherMap API for data about air pollution.
Take a look at the API: https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution

1. To use the App, rename the keys-SAMPLE.js file to keys.js.
2. Get a free API-Key from https://openweathermap.org/ and insert it into the keys.js file. If you alreade have a key, of course you can simply use that one.
